Introduction
============
The smemlcd library provides C library (with Python 3 bindings) for Sharp
Memory LCDs

    http://www.sharpmemorylcd.com/

At the moment only 2.7" LCD screen (LS027B7DH01) is supported.

The screen was tested with Raspberry Pi and Kuzyatech Sharp Memory LCD
breakout A2

Connecting 2.7" LCD
===================
The LCD should be connected to Raspberry Pi using the following connection
scheme::

    Breakout            Raspberry Pi
    --------------------------------
    VIN                 3V3 Power
    GND                 Ground
    DISP                GPIO 25
    SCS                 GPIO 24
    SI                  GPIO 10 (MOSI)
    SCLK                GPIO 11 (SCLK)

SPI Message Length
==================
SPI message length limit is 4096 bytes on Raspberry Pi by default. For 2.7"
screen it has to be increased to 12482 bytes.

Add the following parameter into /boot/cmdline.txt file if spidev module is
built into kernel::

    spidev.bufsiz=12482

Otherwise, create /etc/modprobe.d/spidev.conf file with the following
contents::

    options spidev bufsiz=12482

Using Library
=============
The library is very basic and does not provide any drawing primitives.
Additional library like PIL or Cairo should be used to create framebuffer,
draw in the framebuffer and finally send the framebuffer to the LCD.

See `examples` directory for various examples.
